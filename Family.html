    <h3>Pets</h3>
    <p>We have one dog and her name is Daisy, she is a black goldendoodle and about 5 years old.</p>
    <p>We also have a cat, Luna, whose age isn't known because she was adopted.</p>
    <i>We got Daisy after Luna, and their initial reaction to one another was not pleasant, but they have since
        tolerated one another</i>
    <i>I actually don't live at home anymore, I moved out so I could be closer to Columbia and school.</i>
    <i>I have two roomates, one is my Fraternity dad (big) which means he helped me through the pledge process and
        taught me stuff about the fraternity.</i>
    <i>The other is my close friend who I met at Skyzone, but she since quit to cheer for her college and get a coffee
        job.</i>
    <i>We don't have any pets in our East Campus apartment but I plan on getting a dog when the weather is more
        consistent.</i>
