    <h1>Hello, my name is Bryce Cloud.</h1>
    <p>This website is going to be about me.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am attending the University of Missouri as a psychology major.</p>
    <P>I honestly don't know what I plan to do with that degree if I continue to follow it but its an interesting field
        for me.</P>
    <p>I took this class as an elective because I was interested in information technology.</p>
    <p>Here SOME of the CSS code for this page:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            body {
                background-color: #FA9884;
            }
            h1, h2, h3 {
                text-align: center;
            
                color: #E74646;
            }
            
            p {
                color: #FFE5CA;
                text-align: center;
            }
    </code>
