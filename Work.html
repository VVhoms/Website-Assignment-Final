    <h3>Firework's stand</h3>
    <p>I worked at a fireworks stand in 2017 in Hallsville.</p>
    <p>I specifically had to stock all the fireworks that people bought and remember it being really hot.</p>
    <p>The work wasn't anything too bad though, and I walked away with $300 dollars in a span of 3 days.</p>
    <h3>Sonic in Centralia Mo</h3>
    <p>This was my "second" job but It was more like my first actual one.</p>
    <p>I was a carhop at Sonic which meant I took the food out to the people.</p>
    <p>Honestly I didn't care much for this job, it was long hours for minimum wage.</p>
    <p>Also the people you had to deal with were sometimes exhausting.</p>
    <p>I blame their crazy deals they have on mozzarella sticks or corn-dogs some days.</p>
    <h3>Skyzone (Current)</h3>
    <p>I currently and working at Skyzone as a manager.</p>
    <p id="years-skyzone">I've been there for three and a half years and started at the bottom.</p>
    <p>Originally it was my co-workers who let me deal with the kids and parents, however through time most have left.
    </p>
    <p>Now, if I wasn't a manager I don't think I'd be working there.</p>
